                    <p>
                        <span>Heyoo!</span> <br>
                        <br>
                        The name is Mikk, but preferably Mike. I'm an independent freelancer on the fields of graphic design, digital art and 3d art. <br>
                        <br>
                        My adventure started in my childhood like with all of us. I loved drawing dragons or fantasy-like things, things that aren't possible or can't be acquired or found easily in real life. In my opinion, I had no noticable skill or talent but to my parents I was rather good, but you know parents tend to be like that anyway. <br>
                        <br>
                        In middle school You usually would have seen me drawing something- sketches, doodles, full size pictures, you name it. During break AND during class - <span> AyAyAy, Mike.</span> <br>
                        It was my chance to relax and calm down because I felt like all the other kids were quite loud and crazy. Yeah I know - quite the loner (social anxiety also had some affect in this), but eventually drawing got some of my classmates intrigued. They started to take more glimpses at what I was doing and we became best friends for life. <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <div class="read-more-content">
                        <p>
                            It may come as a surprise that by that time I wasn't part of an art club of some sorts. Well, I wanted to but I was too afraid to join. I thought that I was just a kid without talent who was scribbling something on a paper. I felt inferior because art club for me seemed like the community of Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent can Gogh (high class artists) and so on. I was terrified of someone criticising me down to my core for not being fit for the task. So I never gave it a shot. <br>
                            This was my life for the entire Elementary school. My art teacher didn't let me off the hook, though. She had noticed me and sent me to an art competition where I managed to get second place. But even so, I believed that it must have been some sort of mistake. <br>
                            <br>
                            After I graduated, I had to go to a high school in a different city because my home town school only had nine grades. So in PÃ¤rnu Koidula High school, I finally joined an art club. Not because I wanted to, but because completing a club activity was necessary to graduate. Over there I did some fantastic works which made my new teacher notice me and to my surprise she also sent me to a competition where the same scenario happened. I got second place again and I didn't believe in my skills. <br>
                            <br>
                            A year after graduation and even though I enjoyed the art course quite a lot, I decided to follow the path which was recommended to me so I stopped making art and moved on to university. Taltech was the worst decision ever. I fell into depression. Had to live somewhere I had no free, quiet space to study, had constant flow of studies from completely different topics, had no time to research the subjects I may have liked further- I burned out, I managed getting through one semester (half a year) but then I was at the end of my rope so I quit. <br>
                            <br>
                            After university I decided to enrol into some courses. By then I was strongly influenced by the urge of art but still didn't believe it to be successful so I decided to study something similar but with "practical" use. I began studying drawing architecture blueprints. Compared to Taltech I enjoyed the process. There was no rush and I had time to learn profoundly. But after graduation I felt empty. The profession was boring, rough and everything had to be made by following certain guidelines - (the complete opposite of what I had the hidden urge for ). Even though I had completed the course with remarkable results and was at the top of my class I felt lost because I knew this was not what I wanted. <br>
                            <br>
                            After this saga my counsellor recommended me to give a shot at graphic design. I missed my chance due the fact that the time to enrol was already over so I had to do it the following year. While I was waiting for the next year's selection I went to work alongside my father to kill some time and get paid. I was mainly a heavy equipment operator on the excavator in the swamp. Despite the lack of experience I was actually pretty good but I hated the job because it was draining and repetitive. <br>
                            <br>
                            While working I was also making my portfolio. I had a ton of fun doing it but I wasn't sure of my works because over half were created digitally and I had no experience whatsoever... well if we don't consider Udemy courses of Blender and a bunch of tutorials from Youtube.
                            Then the time arrived. I had an interview where I presented my work and oh boyo boy it was nerve-wracking (social anxiety, mates, social anxiety). After the interview I was relieved. I managed to successfully present myself and the thought âat least I tried" meant a lot for me. <br>
                            <br>
                            Then the results came in and to my surprise I got accepted. <span> Oh hell yeah!</span> <br>
                            I accepted to study right a way. For now I'm still studying while my needs of creation are fulfilled. Although the graduation period will arrive soon I've had so much fun and I've learned so much. <br>
                            The graphic designer profession has given me the enthusiasm to continue this path. I feel the urge to jump deep into the world of digital art. Right now I'm mostly consumed by a 3d software named Blender but in the future when having mastered Illustrator, Photoshop and After Effects I will widen my area with Unreal Engine 5 for the grave interest of creating cinematic scenes with minimal equipment I have right now. <br>
                            <br>
                            I still have much to learn and I have so many ideas to bring to life, but I can assure You this: <br>
                            <br>
                            <span>I have now found my way!</span> <br>
                            <br>
                            P.S. I also want to thank all the people who have supported and encouraged me since my birth. I always had thought that with art you cannot succeed if you are not a well-known skilled artist but damn was I so wrong. Thank you for supporting me! â¤ï¸ð¤
